## Installation and Usage
Crosshair++ officialy supports Linux and Windows. Just download the latest release from [the releases page](https://github.com/Drumba08/crosshairpp/releases).
Then you can unpack it somewhere (like on your desktop), and run the executable (for Windows its Crosshair++.exe, for linux bin/crosshair++).

Starting the program will display the crosshair on screen, and add a tray icon, which can be clicked to access the settings.
